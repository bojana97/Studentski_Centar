## General info

The "Student Center" application is used to monitor the overall situation in the student pavilion, 
like available rooms and non-available rooms, information on students who have contract with the Student Center,
their payments, and information on administrators who have booked it.

The application was created for the purpose of a better understanding of the C# programming language,
as well as a more concrete use of stored procedures within the database.
